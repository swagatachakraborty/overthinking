				<h2>What is Overthinking? </h2>
				<p class="question">
					When you think too much, instead of acting and doing things, you are overthinking. When you analyze, comment and 
					repeat the same thoughts over and again, instead of acting, you are overthinking.
				</p>

				<h2>Is it good or bad ?</h2>

				<p class="question">

								We are always told to think it all over, but sometimes thinking too much harms, big time. Especially emotionally.

								It's perfectly fine to overthink. There's nothing wrong with it. Just avoid to exhibit that in words or through body language.
